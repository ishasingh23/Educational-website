        <h2 >What is artificial Intelligence-
        </h2>
        <p><b style="font-family: Livvic;">Artificial intelligence is a theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
           <br> For Example - Speech recognition, decision-making, visual perception, are features of human intelligence that artificial intelligence may possess.
           <br>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.<br> Specific applications of AI include-
           <ul>
               <li> Expert systems</li>
               <li> Natural language processing</li>
               <li> Speech recognition</li>
               <li> Machine vision</li>
           </ul></b>
             </p>
             <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Types Of Artificial Intelligence-</h2>
             <ul><b>
                 <li>Reactive</li>
                 <li>Limited memory</li>
                 <li>Theory of mind</li>
                 <li>Self-aware.</li>
                </b>
             </ul>
             <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Need Of AI-</h2>
             <p style="padding-top: 15px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – <span style=" font-family: Livvic; color:cornflowerblue;"> chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing.</span></b>
            <ul><b>
                <li>AI automates repetitive learning and discovery through data.</li>
                <li>AI achieves incredible accuracy through deep neural networks.</li>
                <li>AI adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming.</li>
                <li>AI gets the most out of data. When algorithms are self-learning, the data itself is an asset.</li>
                <li>AI adds intelligence to existing products. Many products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities, much like Siri was added as a feature to a new generation of Apple products.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 >Fact related to Artificial Intelligence-</h2>
            <h3 style="color:darkmagenta;">1. AI will Become Smarter than Humans-</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">AI can learn anything quickly, meaning its intelligence is increasing. In 2013, AI had the same intelligence as a 4 year old. By 2029, AI will have the same intelligence level as adult humans.
            </b></p>
            
            <h3 style="color:darkmagenta;">2. Humans can Develop Romantic Relationship with AI-</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">David Levy, a student in this field, believes that marriage between humans and robots will be made legal by 2050. At the moment robots are not so advanced enough for this.
            </b></p>
            <h3 style="color:darkmagenta;">3. AI can Write-</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">A robot wrote an article on an earthquake in California on the Los Angeles Times website, gathering data from a seismograph.
            </b></p>
            <h3 style="color:darkmagenta;">4. AI can Repair Itself-</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">A robot that rebuilt itself after noticing its performance had dropped after losing two of its six legs. The robot did not know what the problem was but fixed it by trial and error.
            </b></p>
            <h3 style="color:darkmagenta;" >5. Most AI Bots are Female-</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px;"><b style="font-family: Livvic;">Studies show that most of the population prefer the sound of a female voice over a male voice. It is because if you ask voice assistants like Alexa, Siri a question, you will be answered by a pleasant and polite woman’s voice.

            <p style="font-family:Lobster; justify-content: center;align-items: center; padding-left: 30%;color:maroon;">“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….<br> It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate <br>, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.”
